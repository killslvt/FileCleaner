This C# program is designed to clean temporary files from the system and optionally empty the Recycle Bin. It performs the following tasks:

Identify Temporary Directories:

- User's App Data Temp Directory
- Windows Temp Directory
- Windows Prefetch Directory

Delete Files and Subfolders:

- Prompts the user before starting the deletion process.
- Recursively deletes all files and subfolders in the specified directories.

Empty Recycle Bin (Optional):

- Asks the user if they want to empty the Recycle Bin after cleaning the directories.
- Empties the Recycle Bin if the user confirms.
The program uses the 'SHEmptyRecycleBin' function from the Windows API for Recycle Bin operations and includes error handling with console output to indicate the status of each operation.
